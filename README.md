## TODO Tasks
- Test cases
- Animations

## Tech components
- **React-Native**
   - Code Reusability. The biggest advantage of React Native is that developers don't need to create separate codes for different platforms (Android and iOS).
- **Expo** 
  We have used Expo for 
   - Easy Downloadable.
   - The Fastest Way To Build React Native Apps.
   - Publish Over The Air (OTA) Updates Instantly.
   - Integrated Access To The Native API.
   - Not All iOS And Android APIs Are Available.
   - Build's Production May Be Delayed.
- **MVP**
  - MVP architecture pattern provides an easy way to structure the project codes. The reason why MVP is widely accepted is that it provides modularity, testability, and a more clean and maintainable codebase.
- **TypeScript**
  - TypeScript Code is converted into Plain JavaScript Code: TypeScript code can’t be natively interpreted by browsers. So if the code was written in TypeScript, it gets compiled and converted into JavaScript. This process is known as Trans-piled. With the help of JavaScript code, browsers are able to read the code and display it.
   - JavaScript is TypeScript: Whatever code is written in JavaScript can be converted to TypeScript by changing the extension from .js to .ts.
   - Use TypeScript anywhere: TypeScript can be compiled to run on any browser, device, or operating system. TypeScript is not specific to any single environment.
   - TypeScript supports JS libraries: With TypeScript, developers can use already existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, or call the TS Code from native JavaScript code.
- **Axios**
  - Axios has the ability to intercept HTTP requests. Fetch, by default, doesn't provide a way to intercept requests. Axios has built-in support for download progress. Fetch does not support upload progress.
- React-Native Navigation
  - React Navigation is one of the most widely used and actively developed libraries out there on the scene. It is also one of the solutions recommended by the React Native team. It’s the community solution being most pushed by Facebook.
- **Redux**
  - Increases the Predictability of a State. In the Redux library, a state is invariably predictable.
  - It is Highly Maintainable.
  - It Prevents Re-renders.
  - Redux Optimizes Performance.
  - Makes Debugging Easier.
  - Useful in Server-Side Rendering. 
  - Provides Ease of Testing.
- **LifeCycle Component**
  - Hooks
  - Functional Components
